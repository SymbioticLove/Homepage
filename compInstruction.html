                <li>Right click anywhere on the web page (the main page, which should still be open)</li>
                <li>Select "Inspect", usually located near the bottom of the list</li>
                <li>In the menu now open on the right-hand side, at the top, select the icon that looks like a tablet and a phone. It will read "Toggle device emulation" if you hover over it.</li>
                <li>In this viewing mode, a new menu will appear at the top. From the drop down list, select a phone, any medium that has a portrait orientation, or "responsive" and define a portrait resolution (where the 2nd number is larger than the 1st; tall, not long)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is the only orientation the website is designed to be compatible for currently. We are working regularly to change that, and your feedback helps!</p>
