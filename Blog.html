                            "This week at Symbiotic Love was a busy one. We fully integrated and optimized our oline store, ordered supplies and merch (more about that in a minute!), got our business cards and started looking into shipping supplier partnerships and event sponsorships for Earth day. If you live in the Phoenix, AZ or Savannah, GA areas, keep a look-out here for updates regarding Earth Day community projects that you can be a part of!
                            We spoke, at length, to an eco-friendly shipping product supplier and are awaiting samples to assure quality, but we believe that we have found our partner for shipping supplies! We will make a more offical announcement of this partnership once the details have become finalized, but it should be expected in the coming weeks. We also ordered tons of merch that we will be giving away at events and selling on our website.
                            These include minimalist mugs, fully-recyclable tote bags, laser-engraved rose gold pens, holographic stickers and more! We will be including one sticker in every order (along with some other goodies!) for free. We expect this to arrive no later than the middle of April, but probably sooner, and will be pictured and posted on our online store shortly thereafter. We are also in the process of testing hand-made, beeswax candles and will be including those soon too! Show your support for sustainablity and altruism! We also finished
                            writing our initial start-up plan, strategy guide and style guide, and fully optimized our website for SEO; for those of you interested in the nitty gritty stuff. We started working on the announcement page for our partnership as well as a slight visual update of the website to bring a little more life and add new ways to navigate the site, and we added this nifty blog so we can keep you updated. We are preparing a kit for our Savannah area brand ambassador and he will also have
                            tons of merch, but his is just for giving away! Reach out to Billy@symbiotic.love for more details if you live or will be in the area, but keep in mind that his kit won't arrive until mid-April at the earliest! Thank you so much for your support, and thank you for being part of a community focused on giving back."

                            "As a socially-conscious and nature-loving individual, I have always been passionate about making a positive impact on the world. This week, I have been working on several projects to promote our brand and spread the word about our mission. One of my main focuses has been on creating a content calendar to generate traffic and keep our future followers updated on upcoming events and news. By sharing regular updates, we hope to keep everyone engaged and informed about the work we are doing to make a positive impact on the world. 
                            We have also been working on getting our beautiful second-hand clothing pictured and posted. We believe in promoting sustainable fashion, and we are excited to share our unique collection of clothing with the world. We also ordered tons of supplies for beautiful handmade/one-of-a-kind jewelry that we will be making with love and light! We are also excited to receive our samples for our eco-friendly packaging from a wonderful sustainable company who we will hopefully soon be partnered with! We believe in promoting sustainability 
                            in all aspects of our brand, and we are proud to partner with like-minded companies and individuals who share our values. For those who are not interested in clothes and jewelry, we will soon be integrating our merch. We are working on getting candles made that will be sustainable and responsibly sourced, made with quality ingredients and are aesthetically pleasing. We believe that everyone can appreciate and want our eco-friendly products that are not only beautiful but also sustainable. Finally, we are excited about Earth Day! 
                            We believe that Earth Day should be every day, but it is nice to have a day designated to honor our beautiful planet as a whole. We are all connected, and we believe in doing as much as possible to spread awareness and inspiration to live and consume consciously. We are grateful for the opportunity to promote our brand and spread awareness of our mission. We hope to inspire others to make a positive impact on the world and help create a better future for all. Thank you so much if you made it this far. You are loved and appreciated.
                            Please feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or advice and follow us on social media. We will begin posting regularly starting this Monday! Sending love and light!"

                            Symbiotic Love would like to extend a warm welcome to the newest addition to our family, Billy Frankow. He will be our brand ambassador in the Savannah, Georgia area helping us to organize events and promote our mission. He has begun his work as well, and will also be looking to organize an Earth Day event in the Savannah area! Again, keep a look-out here if you
                            live or will be in the Savannah, GA or Phoenix, AZ areas around the 22nd and want to be involved! When he recieves his brand ambassador kit, we have empowered him to give away tons of goodies. Keep an eye out for some beautiful, free stuff and check back here regularly from updates from Billy. The latest? "Fuck polution". We couldn't agree more.
